# Multi-Agent Architectures - Open Source Collaboration Platform

Welcome to the "Awesome Multi-Agent Architectures" repository! This collection was created to showcase and share innovative multi agent AI architectures, but these patterns work great with various AI frameworks and development approaches.

Multi-agent architectures represent a sophisticated approach to AI system design, where multiple specialized AI agents collaborate to solve complex problems. These systems can range from simple sequential workflows to complex distributed networks, each with unique strengths and applications.

In this repository, you will find a variety of multi-agent architecture patterns that can be used with different AI frameworks and development approaches. We encourage you to add your own architectures to the list, and to use AI to help generate new patterns as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and explore the architectures in the architectures.md file. You can also use these patterns as inspiration for creating your own multi-agent systems.

We hope you find these architectures useful and have fun exploring the fascinating world of multi-agent AI systems!
